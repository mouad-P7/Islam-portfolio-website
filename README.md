## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to controle background image:

```css
#personnal-info {
    background-image: url("images/background.jpeg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    background-attachment: fixed;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm now understanding the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS3, but I still need practice. 
*Good practice makes you perfect*.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to find and understand every property in css and every tag in html5.
